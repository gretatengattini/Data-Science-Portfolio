    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1: total_added_space -> Supplementary convenience is expensive**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team assumes that the addition of supplementary, convenient architectural elements, particularly porches and attached garages, is positively related to the increase in house sales prices in the Real Estate market. Porches and garages can be extremely convenient for US homeowners for a variety of reasons, which we will explore during real-world impact analysis in section 1B.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root of our hypothesis lies in our realization that convenient elements will not only play a functional role but could also contribute significantly to the practical utility and aesthetics levels of a property. Our team also believes that the higher the area of these environments, the higher the impact on property sale price.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that convenient elements could influence buyers' positive perception of Real Estate products, which could lead to demand generation and, consequently, sales price increases from businesses. Overall, our hypothesis lies in the assumption that the existence and magnitude of convenient home features (particularly porches and garages) might indicate a positive relationship between convenience and sales price.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**H2: baths_rooms_ratio -> Full bathrooms are convenient, but they come with a cost**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team assumes that the higher the ratio of full bathrooms per total count of house rooms, the more expensive the house is going to be in terms of the property sales price.\n",
    "\n",
    "An increased amount of full bathrooms in a house environment is directly linked to a higher sense of convenience and comfort since you enhance the utility of simple half bathrooms by adding a shower/bathtub. Our hypothesis lies in the assumption that this convenient, supplementary feature of a house possessing more full bathrooms per room could be related to higher property sale price.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "**H3: 2suv_accommodation -> Storing big cars demands more structure and, consequently, more investment**\n",
    "\n",
    "North Americans love Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs). According to a research study conducted by Motor1 (2022), SUVs are the most preferred vehicle type by North Americans, representing 53.5% of the total utility automotive market in 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that houses that can store at least 2 large SUVs (based on garage area) are more popular when it comes to clients' preferences and, consequently, demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full-sized SUV is, on average, 16 feet long and has a width of approximately 7 feet (Ibiknle, 2024), which indicates that 2 units of this model would occupy a space of approximately 224 sq ft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on secondary research, we identified that an average garage size is 400 sq ft (Djhamilton, 2023). We can conclude that an average-sized garage can store 2 average-sized SUVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis lies in the fact that we assume Real Estate business analysts are aware of SUV preference in the United States. Therefore, we believe that houses with garage areas that are equal to or greater than 400 sq ft and that can store at least 2 cars are related to increased sales prices in Real Estate.\n",

    "### b. PRACTICAL EXPLANATION ###\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature 1: 'total_added_space'**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world reasons related to the feature that have been identified as contributing to a home's appeal:\n",
    "- A porch next to an attached garage creates a unified appearance that enhances curb appeal and functionality, increasing the desirability of the home (Appraisal Institute, 1994).\n",
    "- Porches provide a quiet outdoor space for relaxation and entertainment, while garages provide secure storage for outdoor items, enhancing the quality of lifestyle through their combined utility (Frederick, 2005).\n",
    "- Homeowners can also store outdoor gear on their porch area (4 Advantages of adding a porch to your home, 2022).\n",
    "- A garage functionality goes further than simply an area where homeowners can park their cars. Individuals who own a garage can use its vast space to store goods and protect belongings. Garages could be used as a new, convenient entrance to one's house. In some specific cases, garages can also be transformed into extra rooms in case it is not needed for parking (Soda, 2023).\n",
    "- A well-maintained porch can significantly increase the market price of a property, especially since outdoor spaces are increasingly valued in current living trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature 2: 'baths_rooms_ratio'**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world reasons related to the feature that have been identified as contributing to a home's appeal:\n",
    "- More bathrooms means that people have more personal space and less need to wait or coordinate bathroom use, which is a significant convenience. This is particularly attractive in family homes or shared living situations where several people need to get ready at the same time (Appraisal Institute (U.S.). (1994). Appraising residential properties (2nd ed.). Appraisal Institute).\n",
    "- Contemporary home buyers often seek amenities that are in keeping with a comfortable, modern lifestyle. The presence of a bathroom attached to each bedroom, often referred to as an \"en-suite,\" is considered a desirable feature that can make a home stand out in the housing market (Gates, J. (2011, October 19). Extra bathroom key in increasing house value: Columnist Jeremy Gates rounds up all the latest property news and reveals what improvements add the most value to your home. Llanelli Star, p. 10).\n",
    "- More bathrooms allow for flexible living arrangements, such as accommodating guests or renting out rooms.\n",
    "- In larger homes, having bathrooms accessible from different living areas, including bedrooms, increases the functionality of the home. It eliminates the need to traverse large spaces to reach the bathroom, bedroom, and half bath.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature 3: '2suv_accommodation'**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world reasons related to the feature that have been identified as contributing to a home's appeal:\n",
    "- North Americans like SUVs. According to Motor1 (2022), more than half of purchased vehicles in the United States are SUVs.\n",
    "- An average garage size is approximately 400 sq ft (Djhamilton, 2023). This sizing is more than enough to comfortably store 2 large-sized SUV models.\n"

Based on the correlation coefficients from our statistical tests (0.66 for Sale_Price and 0.67 for log_Sale_Price), we can infer that the new feature total_added_space is positively related to a higher sale price.\n",

This could be explained by our assumption being closer to the truth - added supplementary, convenient spaces might be a direct indicator of property sales price increase. Future analyses would be needed to understand at what levels these supplementary home areas affect sales prices but correlation results go in the same direction of our primary hypothesis.\n",

Although large garage areas for SUV accommodation could be linked with a higher Sale Price, our correlation results do not allow us to state with confidence that these variables have a positive relationship. Our team was surprised with these results as we expected much higher values for correlation coefficients based on secondary research and assumptions provided."
