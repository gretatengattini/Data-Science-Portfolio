    "## Finding Nemo Adventure Game\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Finding Nemo\" is a 2003 animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures (Stanton, A., & Unkrich, L. (Directors). (2003). _Finding Nemo_ [Film]. Pixar Animation Studios; Walt Disney Pictures).\n",
    "\n",
    "Directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich, the movie follows Marlin, an overprotective clownfish, whose son Nemo is captured by scuba divers and ends up in a fish tank in a dentist's office in Syndey. Marlin, accompanied by Dory, a forgetful blue fish, embarks on a journey to rescue Nemo. Meanwhile, Nemo, determined to escape the dentist’s tank, collaborates with the Tank Gang, a group of aquarium fish. Marlin and Dory face various challenges, including encounters with sharks, jellyfish, and a whale. Ultimately, Nemo successfully blocks the tank's filter, causing chaos in the dentist's office. The story converges as Marlin, Dory, and Nemo reunite and, with the help of other fish, escape a fishing trawler's net. The film ends with Marlin more confident, Nemo heading to school, and the Tank Gang escaping into Sydney Harbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Python game, designed based on the story of Finding Nemo, the objective is to reunite Nemo with his dad. The player navigates through 4 stages on an adventure with Marlin, Dory, and Nemo. Each stage is unique, with elements of randomness such that the game can be played at least three times and be completely different each time. The game includes puzzles and riddles, each with a varying nature (e.g. navigate a map, guess a number, solve a word riddle, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "There shouldn’t be any bugs in the code, but one bug with Jupyter is that sometimes print and input statements are ordered incorrectly (e.g. the input is displayed above the print, even if the input statement comes later in the code)."
